# Frontend

The frontend uses Nextjs framework and has the following pages:
- Login Page 
- Signup Page 
- Url shortener dashboard

`env.example` has been provided as the `.env` template. The frontend only requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to be present in the running system. Either create the `.env` or inject/set as the variable in the system.
